 1. Make sure you have HSQLDB running on your pc.
 2. I have created the database with the following config. Apply the same.
    server.database.0 = file:hsqldb/demodb
    server.dbname.0 = testdb
 3. Open the project in maven based environment. INTELLIJ IDEA Recommendded.
 4. Run the SpringBootApplication Main method.
 5. In controllers > MasterController.java you will find all the corrsponding controllers to observe the project and things are pretty much self explinotory there.
-> you can run setup table api to get dummy content.
